# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

🎯 Purpose
Why This Project?

The Task Manager API is a backend system designed to:

    Demonstrate Core Backend Skills

        A practical implementation of Node.js + Express best practices.

        Focus on RESTful API design, authentication, and database modeling with MongoDB.

    Solve a Real-World Problem

        Provides a structured way for users to create, organize, and track tasks (e.g., for personal productivity or team workflows).

        Securely manages user-specific data with JWT authentication and encrypted passwords.

    Serve as a Learning Tool

        Ideal for developers learning:

            How to build scalable APIs.

            How to integrate JWT for security.

            How to structure MongoDB schemas (e.g., task-user relationships).

    Foundation for Extensions

        Can be extended with:

            Frontend clients (React, Vue, etc.).

            Advanced features (webhooks, real-time updates with Socket.io, or user roles).

Target Users

    👩💻 Developers: A reference for building authenticated APIs.

    📱 Frontend Developers: Ready-to-integrate backend for task-management apps.

    � Hobbyists: A template to experiment with Node.js/MongoDB.

Key Differentiators

✔ Minimalist but Powerful – Focuses on essentials (no bloat).
✔ Clear Documentation – Easy to understand and modify.
✔ Modular Code – Easy to add new features (e.g., due dates, categories).
